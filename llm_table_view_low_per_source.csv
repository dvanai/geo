## Nature & Gentle Walks

### 1. Stanley Park Seawall Stroll
Walk or bike the 10 km seawall around Stanley Park for ocean, mountain, and city views. You can do just a short section if you want it very mellow.

- Highlights: Totem poles, Third Beach, Prospect Point, Lost Lagoon.
- How to relax: Go early morning or near sunset to avoid crowds; grab a coffee and just wander.

### 2. Queen Elizabeth Park & Bloedel Conservatory
Queen Elizabeth Park is quieter than Stanley Park and has great city views from the highest point in Vancouver.

- Relaxing ideas:
  - Sit in the quarry garden or rose garden with a book.
  - Visit the Bloedel Conservatory (warm, glass dome with tropical plants and birds – very calming).

### 3. Beach Time: Kitsilano, English Bay, or Spanish Banks
For a laid‑back beach afternoon:

- **Kitsilano Beach (Kits Beach)** – Easy to reach, cafés nearby, volleyball courts, people-watching.
- **English Bay** – Right by downtown; great for sunset.
- **Spanish Banks** – Quieter, more open, with views of the North Shore mountains.

### 4. Capilano River Regional Park or Lynn Canyon (North Vancouver)
If you want forest without the tourist crush of Capilano Suspension Bridge Park:

- **Capilano River Regional Park** – Trails, river views, Cleveland Dam.
- **Lynn Canyon Park** – Free suspension bridge, forest trails, waterfalls.

Both are accessible by transit from downtown.
